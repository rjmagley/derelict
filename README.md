# Derelict

Derelict is a roguelike game by Ryan Magley (Epsilon Plus).

## About

A roguelike inspired by DoomRL - move from left to right across the level, destorying enemies with a mix of gunfire, melee combat and psychic powers.

Consider this to be in pre-alpha. The game does *nominally* run and is *in theory* a game - but there are no guarantees of balance or even enjoyment at this juncture, and I am not yet creating releases or binaries for use.

You can set up a virtual environment for the game using pipenv - eventually I will add a requirements.txt file for those that prefer using something other than pipenv for development.
