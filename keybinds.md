# Keybinds

## Movement
You can use the number pad, arrow keys (unadvised - you'll want to move on the diagonal) or vim keys.

vim keys for movement are:
y  k  i

h     l

b  j  n

## Other Keys
g: Grab item - ammunition is automatically grabbed if you have room for it
i: Inventory - you can equip/swap handheld weapons from here, or use consumables. Changing your heavier shoulder weapons or armor has to be done during the intermission step between floors.
x: Examine/look - doesn't do much yet, Escape to end
f: Fire weapon in main hand
Shift-T: Fire auxillary weapons or offhand weapon - you'll get a choice of weapons to fire
r: Reload weapon in main hand - eventually this will be expanded to handle reloading other weapons, maybe a special selection for which weapon to reload?
c: Cast a power - select with letter keys, use movement keys to target the cursor if necessary. Some powers will automatically fire on the appropriate target when selected.
\>: Go down stairs. (For now, this will send you down to the next level immediately for testing purposes.)

%: player status screen

When targeting with weapons/powers:
f: fire weapon/power
tab: switch to next target in view

Ctrl-P: message log
